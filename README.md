Program Description:

This course is designed for data scientists and data analysts, as well as professionals who wish to turn large volumes of data into actionable insights. Because of the broad nature of the information, the course is well suited for both early career professionals and senior managers. Since this is not an introductory course, the faculty strongly recommends participants to have substantial background knowledge of statistical techniques and data calculations or quantitative methods of data research.

 <b>Module 6: Predictive Modeling for Temporal Data</b>
 
  <h3>Case study 1: New York City</h3>

 - Case Study Description: To predict the trip duration of a new york taxi cab ride, build different types of features and evaluate them. We will start by describing what a feature is in this context, then develop some very simple features and add features using the software package featuretools. We will assess how these features perform in predicting trip duration.
